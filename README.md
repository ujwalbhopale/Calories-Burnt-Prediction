This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burned during physical activity using biometric and exercise-related features such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The analysis includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations, followed by the application of multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. Among all models, XGBoost achieved the best performance with the lowest error metrics and highest R² score. This project demonstrates the full data science pipeline—from data preprocessing and visualization to model evaluation—using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and xgboost
